## About
This is an app based on 
[challenge](https://gist.github.com/giorgobiani/fdabffe1c745f2e3c9913a5f79a4fdc9) provided for 
[BitCamp](https://www.bitcamp.ge/) by
[Optio.ai](https://www.optio.ai/).
The challenge has been quite fun, but at times frustrating. The API is very inconssistent and the challenge instructions were at times unclear. Nevertheless,
it was worth a try, especially because I have never used echarts before.
